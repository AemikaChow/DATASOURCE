## attribute
> * DeepFashioin dataset [[homepage]](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion.html) <p align="justify">DeepFashion contains over 800,000 diverse fashion images ranging from well-posed shop images to unconstrained consumer photos. Each image in this dataset is labeled with 50 categories, 1,000 descriptive attributes, bounding box and clothing landmarks.</p>
## keypoints
> * LandmarkDetection dataset [[homepage]](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion/LandmarkDetection.html) <p align="justify">123,016 number of clothes images; 8 fashion landmarks (both location and visibility) for each image; Each image is also annotated by bounding box, clothing type and variation type</p>
> * DeepFashion2 dataset [[homepage]](https://github.com/switchablenorms/DeepFashion2) <p align="justify">DeepFashion2 is a comprehensive fashion dataset. It contains 491K diverse images of 13 popular clothing categories from both commercial shopping stores and consumers. It totally has 801K clothing clothing items, where each item in an image is labeled with scale, occlusion, zoom-in, viewpoint, category, style, bounding box, dense landmarks and per-pixel mask.There are also 873K Commercial-Consumer clothes pairs.</p>
## parsing
> * LIP dataset [[homepage]](http://sysu-hcp.net/lip/) <p align="justify">The dataset is an order of magnitude larger and more challenge than similar previous attempts that contains 50,000 images with elaborated pixel-wise annotations with 19 semantic human part labels and 2D human poses with 16 key points. The images collected from the real-world scenarios contain human appearing with challenging poses and views, heavily occlusions, various appearances and low-resolutions.</p>
